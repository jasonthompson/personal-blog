This processing sketch is based on Example 3.7 in Daniel Shiffman's excellent book, <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a>, but I removed the line connecting each ellipse to the centre, added some colour and trails and used my own numbers for velocity and amplitude rather than generating them randomly. The patterns created by the oscillators are sized in relation to one another using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a>.
