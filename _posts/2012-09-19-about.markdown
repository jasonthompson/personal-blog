I am many things: writer, programmer, bureaucrat, photographer, cyclist, father, husband and trouble maker. For years Iâ€™ve fretted about spreading my interests too thin instead of focusing exclusively on one of these things. But recently I realized that these things might connect in interesting ways. I hope to develop that line of thinking with this blog. In other words, there are no off-topic posts here.
