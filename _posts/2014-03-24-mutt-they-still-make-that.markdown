So I've been using [Mutt]() as my primary email client for a few days. Before I justify my choice of email clients, let me give some background. I run my own email server. So far this has not lead to the kind of pain I was told to expect. I've had 100% uptime to my knowledge. But my main issue has been with choosing an email client. My main computer at home is a linux laptop. I don't like Evolution, which is really just an Outlook clone, Kmail is a UI nightmare and Mozilla stopped developing Thunderbird. I also needed a way of checking my personal email at work. For a while, [Roundcube](), a self-hosted webmail app, solved my problems, but it had its issues, the biggest of which was its lack of keyboard shortcuts.
