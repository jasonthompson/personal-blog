  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p>Turning off the internet on our eight-year-old daughter’s computer turned out to be one of the best parental decisions MM and I have made. Like many parents we constantly wrestle with how to control her access to media. I have always believed that outright bans of TV or internet are a bad idea; you just end up making whatever you’re banning more desirable. And they’ll find ways of gaining that access through friends anyway. Wouldn’t you rather be around when they’re consuming media to make sure they’re picking up the critical skills they need? So we haven’t banned her internet use altogether. If she wants to check email or log onto a favourite web site, she can do so on our computers while we’re hanging around.</p>

<p>But she rarely asks to go online these days. Instead she has channeled her considerable creativity into making stuff on her computer. She writes stories in Pages (complete with images from iPhoto), edits slideshows with audio commentary and music in iMovie, designs multimedia programs in Scratch (a kids programming environment from MIT) and, just now, she came in to tell me about a comedy podcast she’s writing. When she had access to the internet on her computer, she always wanted to consume. Now she’s producing her own content.</p>

<p>And the most incredible thing of all is that she has figured out how to do this stuff on her own. I showed her Pages and she took it from there. She discovered iMovie herself and figured out how to make the slideshows. I’m not bringing this up to brag, although I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t glowing with pride at this. I bring this up because it’s surprising what happens when you limit your child’s easy access to media consumption. They’re full of creativity and I’d bet that they would rather produce than consume any day.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/12/early-experiences-with-e-books">Early Experiences With E-Books</a></h1>
  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p>If e-books aren’t somehow on your radar at the end of 2010 you’ve probably been lost all year in that Labyrinthine monastic library from Eco’s <cite class="bookTitle">The Name of the Rose</cite>. <a title="Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Device-Display/dp/B0015T963C">Amazon’s Kindle</a> has dominated the e-book space so far, but there’s also <a title="iBooks" href="http://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/features/ibooks.html">Apple’s iBooks</a> and the recently-launched <a title="Google ebookstore" href="http://books.google.com/ebooks">Google ebookstore</a>. And these are just the biggest players. Unsurprisingly there has been a lot of talk about what the e-book will mean for traditional publishing, book buying and authorship.</p>

<p>But I’d like to leave these big questions aside for now to explore my early experiences <em>reading</em> e-books. Halfway through reading my fourth e-book, I’m ready to organize my thoughts on what it’s like to read an e-book and how that compares with traditional reading. But first some context. To give you a sense of the type of books I’m discussing, I list the e-books I’ve read (or, in the last case, I’m still reading) below in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jack Kerouac’s <cite class="bookTitle">Dharma Bums</cite></li>
	<li>K.J. Bishop’s <cite class="bookTitle">The Etched City</cite></li>
	<li>Jeff VanderMeer’s <cite class="bookTitle">City of Saints and Madmen</cite></li>
	<li>John Gardner’s <cite class="bookTitle">The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>So far I have purchased all of these books through Kindle, using the iPhone Kindle app to read them. I tried downloading a free version of Milton’s <cite class="bookTitle">Paradise Lost</cite> using iBooks, but the iPhone app seems to choke on it, running so slowly that the poem is unreadable. I have also had trouble finding the books I want to read in the iBooks store. For example I couldn’t find any of VanderMeer’s books there. I hold out hope that this will change, but for now, the Kindle store has served me well.</p>

<p>The first thing many people say when I tell them that I’ve been reading books on my iPhone is, “how can you read on that tiny screen?” I haven’t had any issues with the size of the iPhone 3g’s screen or the resolution. I stare at a computer monitor all day and that takes its toll on my eyes. But I don’t feel any eye strain reading my iPhone’s screen, even after a day in front of my computer. By all accounts, the new Android and Apple models have even better resolution, so an already good situation only gets better.</p>

<p>And there are advantages to reading on such a small device. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of reading a brick of a book like David Foster Wallace’s <cite class="bookTitle">Infinte Jest</cite> or Joyce’s <cite class="bookTitle">Ulysses</cite>, you will understand what I mean when I say that’s it’s a pleasure reading a book that you can easily hold in one hand. Even better, you’ve also got an entire library of books inside this tiny device that’s always in your pocket. As long as you remember to bring your phone with you, you’ll never be bored on the subway or in a waiting room again.</p>

<p>In the Kindle app, turning a page is a simple matter of tapping the right hand side of the screen with the thumb of the hand that’s holding the phone. This is actually surprisingly easy. In fact I find that I flip pages unconsciously, making the reading experience flow as if you were reading a continuous pageless text. In this sense, it’s fitting that the first e-book I read was by Kerouac who wrote another one of his works, <cite class="bookTitle">On the Road</cite>, as a continuous scroll.</p>

<p>But this pageless flow has it’s drawbacks. I miss the experience of intuitively knowing exactly where I am in a text by the thickness of the unread pages. Although the Kindle app provides a scroll bar at the bottom of the screen that indicates your place in the book, I still feel a bit lost. I have grown up with this physical feel for my progress through a book and it’s hard to leave this behind. I still find it easier to flip back through real pages to re-read a section or to flip forward to see where the chapter ends.</p>

<p>Then again the lack of pages works well with endnotes, which, in the Kindle app are hyperlinks. In <cite class="bookTitle">City of Saints and Madmen</cite>, one of the stories is full of endnotes. You simply tap the link, which brings you to the endnote. When you’re done reading it, you tap the back arrow to return to the text. An e-book version of <cite class="bookTitle">Infinite Jest</cite> would have worked so well this way. Flipping back and forth between the text and endnotes in that book was a source of frustration for me, though I’m sure Wallace intended it that way with his endnotes within endnotes. That said, I still had problems with the endnotes in <cite class="bookTitle">City of Saints and Madmen</cite>. I’ve got fat fingers and when the endnote link was at the righthand edge of the page it was difficult to hit it without turning the page. It is possible for iPhone programmers to enlarge the active space around a button or link, so perhaps the developers of the Kindle app could experiment with this. However, this might not be possible due to another feature of the Kindle app: the ability to tap on a word to either leave a note, highlight it or look it up in the dictionary. Widening the active area around an endnote link may interfere with the active area of the word itself.</p>

<p>I haven’t used notes or highlighting yet, but I love the dictionary function. When you tap on a word, its dictionary definition appears in a little box at the top or bottom of the page depending on the location of the word in question. I have always been a bit lazy about opening up a dictionary, so I love this feature. Unfortunately, I have encountered several words that aren’t in the version of the “New Oxford American Dictionary” that comes with the app. Apparently on the actual Kindle device, you have the option of buying a new dictionary and using that as your default dictionary. I hope they add this to the iPhone app, because I would love to upgrade the dictionary to a non-American Oxford English Dictionary with more words. Depending on what you’re reading, this might not even be an issue.</p>

<p>The thing I dislike most about reading e-books is their poor typography. In his piece <a title="Craigmod: Embracing the Digital Book" href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/">Embracing the Digital Book</a>, <a title="Craig Mod" href="http://craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a>, a designer who knows much more about typography than I do, covers all of my issues and more. I don’t have any problems with the font used in all Kindle books, PMN Caecilia, but I find the justified margins distracting. You end up with these awkward three-word lines with jarring space between the words. This could easily be solved with hyphenation. And I would prefer ragged right text like in a normal book. I’ll give Craig Mod the last word on this:&gt;Physical books and e-books are both text at their cores. Book designers long ago established rigorous rules for laying out text blocks so they disappear to the reader. They took pride in turning the physicality of a book into a tool for efficiently and elegantly getting information into the mind of the reader. As any good typographer knows: the best typography goes unnoticed.</p>

<p>I encourage you to read the rest of his piece because, among other things, it includes a fascinating exploration of what e-books could really be.</p>

<p>Craig Mod also points to one of the features I hate about the e-books I’ve read: Digital Rights Management. I love sharing traditional books with friends – to me, this sharing has always been an important part of enjoying books. It makes reading social. Sadly I cannot do this with my Kindle library. I think the publishing business needs to reconsider it’s use of DRM. In the music space, companies like iTunes are making money selling digital music. People buy music on iTunes instead of downloading it for free because it’s easier to do. The same would be true for books. Although social media has emerged to dominate the web, the book world has taken a step away from the social by locking up it’s e-books.</p>

<p>On a related point, it would be nice if I could buy books from multiple sources. Although Kindle and iBooks will never offer this, Google Editions seems to be moving in that direction. Like the DRM issue, this could easily be a topic for another long post, so I’ll only say this: I love small bookstores with their own carefully chosen selection of books.</p>

<p>One final gripe I have has more do with the fact that I’m reading on my iPhone; I am constantly interrupted by incoming emails, texts and phone calls. I don’t mind being interrupted by a phone call since I don’t use the phone much, but the emails and texts really test my ability to focus. It’s somehow easier to ignore the vibration or chime notifications for these messages when the phone is in your pocket. This is probably more a question of retraining myself than anything. But with a paper book, it’s much easier to eliminate distractions like this.</p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to e-books. Some of these disadvantages will likely be overcome. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy them, but, for me, they’re not going to replace traditional books anytime soon. Once I finish reading my most recent e-book acquisition, <cite class="bookTitle">The Art of Fiction</cite>, I will crack open M. John Harrison’s <cite class="bookTitle">Viriconium</cite>, a book that I purchased at a cool neighbourhood used bookstore yesterday.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/12/don-cherrys-performance-of-masculinity">Don Cherry's Performance of Masculinity</a></h1>
  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p>Around the same time that <a title="Transcript of Don Cherry's Speach" href="http://torontoist.com/2010/12/don_cherrys_speech_to_council_transcribed.php">Don Cherry was making a mockery of democracy</a> during Rob Ford’s investiture at Toronto’s City Hall, I read this great piece by <a title="Mumpsimus" href="http://mumpsimus.blogspot.com/">Matthew Cheney</a> at <a title="Strange Horizons" href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/">Strange Horizons</a> called the <a title="Strange Horizons: Failure of Masculinity" href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2010/20101011/cheney-c.shtml">“Failure of Masculinity”</a>. Then, the day after Don Cherry’s infamous appearance in Toronto’s City Hall, I came across <a title="Don Cherry looks like a lady's handbag" href="http://deadspin.com/5530094/don-cherry-looks-like-a-ladys-handbag">this photo of Don Cherry, “Looking like a lady’s handbag”</a>, which prompted the following thoughts. Before continuing on, I strongly recommend that you take the time to read Cheney’s piece.</p>

<p>In “Failure of Masculinity” Cheney discusses suicides of gay men after being regularly subjected to homophobia. He argues that homophobia is a “weapon of sexism”, quoting C.J. Pascoe’s point that: “Achieving a masculine identity…entails the repeated repudiation of the specter of failed masculinity”.</p>

<p>It is instructive to read Don Cherry’s performance on Hockey Night in Canada’s Coach’s Corner as just such a repudiation of failed masculinity. For example, his incoherent right wing rants, his constant “feminisation” of European hockey players vs. their “tougher” North American counterparts and his valorization of fighting all underscore the “power fantasy” of “the ideal masculinity”, that Cheney discusses, wherein “‘real men’ are strong, dominant, and heterosexual.” Cherry’s incoherent right wing rants are “masculine” in this sense, not only because they are couched in “tough guy” language, but also because they are contrasted against McLean’s more “effeminately” eloquent and fair-minded views. Indeed, although the right has always appropriated the language of masculine toughness, it has more recently embraced (starting with Bush Jr.?) inarticulacy as somehow more genuine or authentic then the more considered and better-articulated views of the educated “elites” with their moral relativism and their Priuses. Obviously, you can’t just read this in terms of gender; the enemy of this new right is any manifestation of the Other as demonstrated by the recent “controversy” over Obama’s heritage. But gender plays a big role, especially in Cherry’s case. On the surface you could read his “Lady’s Handbag” suits as a failure of masculinity, but they’re nothing if not loud, brash and tasteless (taste being equated with a kind of visual articulacy). The suits draw the focus away from McLean, placing it squarely on Cherry. They are a perfect visual accompaniment to Cherry’s loud, inarticulate rants. At the same time, he can flirt with this failure of masculinity because his masculinity never comes into question. On the other hand, by the rules of Cherry’s universe, McLean could never dress that way without failing as a man.</p>

<p>During his Toronto City Hall performance a few days ago, Cherry described his suit in aggressive terms as an attack against the effeminate left: “I’m being ripped to shreds by the left-wing pinko newspapers out there–it’s unbelievable. One guy called me a jerk in a pink suit so I thought I’d wear that for him too today.” Wearing a pink suit to spite the pinkos? No ambiguity there.</p>

<p>When people discuss Don Cherry’s performances, they discuss them as if they were harmless antics. But his behaviour is anything but harmless. He performs for a national audience on Coach’s Corner and many of those watching are young boys who are in the process of developing their own ideas about masculinity. It’s possible that Cherry does not understand the ramifications of his public persona, but sexism and homophobia, whether conscious or not, are still harmful. Earlier this week, Cherry stepped into a more overtly political arena. Perhaps this is a none-to-subtle message that his employer, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, should reexamine the harmful ideology it perpetuates every Saturday night during hockey season.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/07/why-do-we-suffer-for-our-fun">Why do we suffer for our fun?</a></h1>
  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p><img class="right" src="/images/2010/07/patia-in-trailer.jpg" alt="Patia in her trailer" width="188" height="250" /></p>

<p>We had taken the right fork (or was it left?) in the rutted sandy trail. It was raining hard again and all of my clothes were soaked. A few minutes earlier, unable to get enough momentum in the wet sand, I had been forced to get off my bike and push it up a hill with my daughter, Patia, in tow. It’s hard enough pulling a bike and child in her trailer up a hill, but in these conditions it took almost all of my strength. After the fork I tried to navigate safely through deep tire ruts along a wide curve, but I felt the trailer tip precariously onto one wheel before righting itself again. “Whoa!” Mary-Margaret, who was cycling behind us, confirmed what I had just felt. Close call. Nothing to do but carry on. We eventually came to a sign with a map of the conservation area as we crossed a narrow rural road. I stopped and tried to cross reference this map with my Water Front Trail map, but we’d clearly gone off course.</p>

<p>Sounds like fun, right? When I tell people about our overnight bike trip from Toronto to Darlington Provincial Park just west of Oshawa, they often tell me they can’t understand why anyone would want to do that. And they probably aren’t even imagining misadventures like the one I describe above. Bike touring can be difficult. You have to try to figure out how to pack a tent, sleeping bags, mats, cooking gear, clothing and various other items into four small bags. All of which adds considerably to your bike’s weight. Then there is the matter of pulling Patia’s trailer – not to mention making sure she is happy and occupied during the long day of pedaling. Oh, and did I mention this was our first real bike tour? This was our test run for a weeklong trip later this summer.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, with our tent set up and a fire crackling in front of us, we both agreed that we felt good about the day. “It’s a lot like a canoe trip,” said MM. “You do a really long, nasty portage with a cloud of black flies around your face in the afternoon heat, but that doesn’t stop you from doing it again.”</p>

<p><img src="/digressions/images/2010/07/our-campsite.jpg" alt="Our campsite" width="500" /></p>

<p>But why? I wondered. My thoughts were interupted by the sound of the electric water pump in the trailer across the road from us. Why not travel in comfort? I looked away from the fire to our campsite: the two bikes, the tent, the soggy clothes hanging to dry and the view of the cloudy sky over the lake through a break in the trees. Here we were 80 km or so from our doorstep and we’d done it under our own power. The challenges we’d faced to get here were just the point. Those of us lucky enough to have well paying jobs and a comfortable place to eat and sleep tend to surround ourselves with so much “comfort” that we lose a vital link to the world around us, even to ourselves. I’m hardly the first person to note this: we learn a lot about ourselves when we strip away these comforts, and expose ourselves to the elements. We learn what’s really necessary, we connect to our environment and we gain a sense of self-reliance that’s hard to come by in a world of excess. And hopefully we come back to our everday world with our priorities realigned.</p>

<p>When people talk about the Northeast Blackout in 2003, it is often with a sense of nostalgia. When electricity, that one layer of comfort, was unavailable for several days, people stepped outside of their cocoons and chatted with their neighbours, had impromptu parties, looked up at the starry night sky together. People are nostalgic for that sense of connection we all enjoyed.</p>

<p>It was getting dark as we dried my socks next to the fire. The day had been difficult. We wouldn’t be able to fully dry our clothes until we got back home the next evening. But it had been a successful day of touring. We had met interesting folks and seen things that you would never see from the comfort of your car. Later, I walked over to the edge of the cliff overlooking the lake and listened to the water gently lapping against the rocky shore. What would tomorrow’s ride home bring?</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/06/overcoming-writers-block">Overcoming Writer's Block</a></h1>
  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p>In the last few days I’ve written 1100 words of a short story. What’s so special about that, you ask? I’ve been plagued with writer’s block for almost a decade. The last substantial piece of fiction I finished was my MFA screenplay a decade or so ago. After graduation life intervened and swallowed me up. Financial issues, career stress and the many challenges of parenthood certainly played their role in stopping me from writing, but the main thing I had to overcome was fear. After the initial elation of finishing a screenplay wore off, I took a second look at it and hated it. After a year of writing, all I had to show for it was a shitty screenplay. I felt that I had failed. I became obsessed with finding the one brilliant idea that I could commit to for the next year or two of writing, but, of course, nothing seemed good enough. Every time I sat down to write, my inner critic – we’ll call him Mr. C – would rip into me for having the audacity to write. It got to the point where I was no longer able to sit down with the intention of writing. I would get an idea and knock it around in my head for a few days before Mr. C finaly put it out of its misery. It got to the point where Mr. C hated my stuff so much that I stopped having ideas.</p>

<p>I realized early on that Mr. C was really just fear of failure. This fear has been there throughout my life, but it gained strength during the last decade. But in the last few years I’ve begun to confront this fear in various ways. Meditation and exercise have been useful allies in this fight, allowing me to control my wayward thoughts. By the beginning of this year I was feeling much better – in January I committed to pushing myself outside of my comfort zone this year. I guess it was inevitable that, given how much better I was feeling, my thoughts would come back to writing. I realized that everything I had done up to that point, even my shitty screenplay, contributed to the next piece of writing. Failure is a vital part of learning. Indeed, I would rather fail than not try at all, because as Mark Twain said, “twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.” It’s tempting to look back at the last ten years with this feeling of disappointment, but I’m getting old and I’m looking to take advantage of the next ten or twenty years.</p>

<p>A while ago I sat down and forced myself to come up with an idea for a story. Then over the next few weeks I grappled with it in my thoughts and in my journal. This time I would finish a project, even if it sucked. Evidently this work loosened up my creativity because a few days ago while I was washing the dishes another idea popped into my head. I finished up in the kitchen and went directly to my office to write the opening paragraphs. I have now established the first hour of my day, from 5:30 until 6:30 as my writing time. It’s not a lot, but the story continues to unfold.</p>

<p>The lesson I’m slowly learning is so simple, it’s embarrassing it’s taken me so long: you can’t write unless you put your ass on your seat and write. Everything starts with that.</p>
