    <p>I’m currently reading <a title="Geeta Dayal's blog" href="http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/">Geeta Dayal’s</a> exploration of Brian Eno’s creative process <a title="Another Green World" href="http://www.amazon.ca/Brian-Enos-Another-Green-World/dp/0826427863/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308077919&amp;sr=8-3">in her book</a> about Brian Eno’s 1975 album, <a title="Wikipedia: Another Green World" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Green_World">Another Green World</a>. One aspect of this creative process that I find particularly fascinating is Eno’s use of <a title="Wikipedia: Generative Music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music">generative techniques</a>. My interest piqued, I read about <a title="Wikipedia: Generative Art" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative techniques in other arts</a> and rediscover <a title="Wikipedia: Jeff Noon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Noon">Jeff Noon’s</a> work via this piece on <a title="Wikipedia: Cut-up technique" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique">Cut-up techniques</a>. I say “rediscover” because Noon’s books fell off the end of my always-growing list of things to read a long time ago, so I’m returning him to the top of this list. Actually–scratch that–maybe not the top. Noon himself contributes to his quick demotion on my list with his <a title="Jeff Noon's top 10 fluid fiction books" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/jan/17/bestbooks.fiction">list of top ten fluid fiction books</a> wherein he recommends <a title="The Age of Wire and String" href="http://benmarcus.com/books/the-age-of-wire-and-string/">Ben Marcus’s “The Age of Wire and String”</a>. Always a sucker for the off-beat and/ or experimental I head on over to Marcus’s site, which links to <a title="I Can't Really Help It: A Conversation with Ben Marcus" href="http://htmlgiant.com/feature/i-cant-really-help-it-a-conversation-with-ben-marcus/">an interesting interview with him</a> at HTMLGiant. And, yet again, a new book is added to the top of my reading list as Marcus recommends John D’Agata’s book-length essay, <a title="About a Mountain" href="http://www.amazon.ca/About-Mountain-John-Dagata/dp/0393339017/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308076049&amp;sr=8-1">About a Mountain</a>, which is described by Booklist as a “circuitous, stylish investigation” in which “D’Agata (Halls of Fame) uses the federal government’s highly controversial (and recently rejected) proposal to entomb the U.S.’s nuclear waste located in Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, as his way into a spiralling and subtle examination of the modern city, suicide, linguistics, Edvard Munch’s The Scream, ecological and psychic degradation, and the gulf between information and knowledge”. I love essays and documentaries that take a collage-like approach. In fact I’m currently developing a multimedia project/ documentary of my own that’s structured this way. So, hungry for a sample of D’Agata’s work, I read his piece, <a title="Joan Didion's Formal Experience of Confusion" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200310/?read=article_dagata">Joan Didion’s Formal Experience of Confusion</a> right away. I am also looking forward to reading his international anthology, <a title="Joan Didion's Formal Experience of Confusion" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200310/?read=article_dagata">The Lost Origins of the Essay</a>,”An expansive and exhilarating world tour of innovative nonfiction writing”.</p>

<p>After a late lunch on the patio of the Bedford Academy, <a title="Peter Van Garderen's blog" href="http://archivemati.ca/about/,">Peter</a> and I wandered up Prince Arthur Avenue to catch a matinée at the Varsity. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and we were in no hurry, so we stopped to admire <a title="Uno Prii Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Prii,">Uno Prii’s</a> Prince Arthur Towers. Like any other city, Toronto is full of bland residential architecture built after WWII, but there are exceptions. Harry Hiller, for one, hired Prii for his projects, resulting in some of Toronto’s finest buildings from the 60s. Today amidst Toronto’s condo boom, most of the new residential buildings are forgettable, to say the least. Sadly, it’s difficult to force a developer to design a building that makes a statement other than, “we’ve spent as little as possible on architecture here”. But, here and there, you can find gems like Prince Arthur Towers that richen the environment around them.</p>

  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <figure><img src="/images/2011/05/curving-road.jpg" alt="curvingroad" /></figure>
<p>In the past few days I’ve made some changes to Digressions, most of which are invisible to readers. The following is a detailed description of these changes. Be forewarned.
&lt;h2 id="changing-platforms-and-hosts"&gt;Changing Platforms and Hosts&lt;/h2&gt;
I’m an inveterate builder. Along with ideas for writing, photography, video and music projects, I’m always entertaining a few software ideas. So a few months ago, I decided to dust off my Ruby skills and learn Ruby on Rails to bring some of these ideas to fruition. I laid the groundwork for this tinkering by moving Digressions to a virtual server at <a title="Slicehost" href="http//www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a>. Having a virtual server gives me the flexibility to set up the programming environment of my choice.</p>

<p>There are plenty of great books and <a title="Michael Hartl's Excellent 'Ruby on Rails Tutorial'" href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">tutorials</a> for Rails, but I learn best by getting my hands dirty, so I decided to write my own blogging platform. For an experienced Rails programmer this could be done in a day or two. For someone like me who has dived in over his head, this took a few months of working an hour or two everyday before going to work. In the end I learned rails, but abandoned the blogging platform leaving it 80% complete.</p>

<p>While I didn’t end up finishing my blogging platform this project taught me a lot. One important thing I learned was to trust my instincts. And my instincts were telling me that Rails is too big for the task at hand. Sure, you could use Rails to create a wonderful blogging platform, but I wanted something simpler. Just as I was coming to this realization, I stumbled across <a title="Jekyll--a blog-aware static site generator for Ruby" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, “a blog-aware static site generator for Ruby”. The concept is simple:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Write your post using the text editor of your choice (I use MacVim) and save it in a folder called “_posts”;</li>
	<li>If you’ve got images, save them in an images folder;</li>
	<li>Run Jekyll at the command line in your blog folder to create the “_site” folder;</li>
	<li>Deploy the contents of the “_site” folder using whatever method you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds more complicated than it actually is. I created a script that takes care of the last two steps automatically.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to this way of doing things. For one thing, “baking” your weblog (i.e., generating static web pages instead of serving dynamic pages) results in better performance when visitor traffic spikes. <a title="A plea for baked weblogs" href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">Brent Simmons</a> and <a title="More on Baking" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/18/Baking-ongoing">Tim Bray</a> recently made strong arguments in favor of baking, so I won’t repeat them here. Another advantage is that your blog is automatically backed up. At the very least there is one copy on your computer and another on your server. Moreover, because there’s always a local copy of your blog and because there are no databases to fiddle with, deploying to a new host is trivial. In contrast, moving a Wordpress or Moveable Type blog can be a pain. But even if you never plan on changing hosts, it’s nice to have your posts living in text files rather than hidden away in a database. Finally, if you want to make changes or add plugins, the Jekyll code is easy to wrap your head around.
&lt;h2 id="design-tweaks"&gt;Design Tweaks&lt;/h2&gt;
While moving Digressions to a new platform, I decided to update the design. To begin with, I reimplemented the existing design using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr>. If you look at the page source, you’ll see that moving to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> paid off in cleaner markup. A lot of the header cruft is gone and semantic tags make your structure clear. And it’s a lot easier to style and/ or modify clearly structured <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. With the new <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in place, I tweaked the design to achieve a cleaner look. The most obvious changes are related to typography. I replaced Anivers, the font I was using for titles, with Adobe’s Myriad Pro Condensed because Anivers wasn’t displaying nicely on Windows XP computers (don’t get me started about Windows XP font rendering). Font sizes where also changed to make the design look more proportional on multiple devices. And taking the advice of <a title="The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web" href="http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.2/">The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a>, I narrowed the paragraphs keeping lines between 65 and 70 characters long to enhance readability.</p>

<p>The redesign is still a work in progress (I <em>did</em> mention I was an inveterate builder). I only have Macs and Linux computers at home, so testing on Internet Explorer is difficult. That said, I have <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 8 at work, so I can check the site there and then make my tweaks at home. It’s currently readable on <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 8, but not as pretty as it is on modern browsers. A while back I made a commitment to stop waisting my time on designing around the quirks of outdated browsers, but I’ll make a few small tweaks to improve rendering in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 8.</p>

<p>Now with all this change out of the way I can start posting words and images again. After all, isn’t that what blogs are for?</p>

  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p>Turning off the internet on our eight-year-old daughter’s computer turned out to be one of the best parental decisions MM and I have made. Like many parents we constantly wrestle with how to control her access to media. I have always believed that outright bans of TV or internet are a bad idea; you just end up making whatever you’re banning more desirable. And they’ll find ways of gaining that access through friends anyway. Wouldn’t you rather be around when they’re consuming media to make sure they’re picking up the critical skills they need? So we haven’t banned her internet use altogether. If she wants to check email or log onto a favourite web site, she can do so on our computers while we’re hanging around.</p>

<p>But she rarely asks to go online these days. Instead she has channeled her considerable creativity into making stuff on her computer. She writes stories in Pages (complete with images from iPhoto), edits slideshows with audio commentary and music in iMovie, designs multimedia programs in Scratch (a kids programming environment from MIT) and, just now, she came in to tell me about a comedy podcast she’s writing. When she had access to the internet on her computer, she always wanted to consume. Now she’s producing her own content.</p>

<p>And the most incredible thing of all is that she has figured out how to do this stuff on her own. I showed her Pages and she took it from there. She discovered iMovie herself and figured out how to make the slideshows. I’m not bringing this up to brag, although I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t glowing with pride at this. I bring this up because it’s surprising what happens when you limit your child’s easy access to media consumption. They’re full of creativity and I’d bet that they would rather produce than consume any day.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/12/early-experiences-with-e-books">Early Experiences With E-Books</a></h1>
  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <p>If e-books aren’t somehow on your radar at the end of 2010 you’ve probably been lost all year in that Labyrinthine monastic library from Eco’s <cite class="bookTitle">The Name of the Rose</cite>. <a title="Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Device-Display/dp/B0015T963C">Amazon’s Kindle</a> has dominated the e-book space so far, but there’s also <a title="iBooks" href="http://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/features/ibooks.html">Apple’s iBooks</a> and the recently-launched <a title="Google ebookstore" href="http://books.google.com/ebooks">Google ebookstore</a>. And these are just the biggest players. Unsurprisingly there has been a lot of talk about what the e-book will mean for traditional publishing, book buying and authorship.</p>

<p>But I’d like to leave these big questions aside for now to explore my early experiences <em>reading</em> e-books. Halfway through reading my fourth e-book, I’m ready to organize my thoughts on what it’s like to read an e-book and how that compares with traditional reading. But first some context. To give you a sense of the type of books I’m discussing, I list the e-books I’ve read (or, in the last case, I’m still reading) below in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jack Kerouac’s <cite class="bookTitle">Dharma Bums</cite></li>
	<li>K.J. Bishop’s <cite class="bookTitle">The Etched City</cite></li>
	<li>Jeff VanderMeer’s <cite class="bookTitle">City of Saints and Madmen</cite></li>
	<li>John Gardner’s <cite class="bookTitle">The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>So far I have purchased all of these books through Kindle, using the iPhone Kindle app to read them. I tried downloading a free version of Milton’s <cite class="bookTitle">Paradise Lost</cite> using iBooks, but the iPhone app seems to choke on it, running so slowly that the poem is unreadable. I have also had trouble finding the books I want to read in the iBooks store. For example I couldn’t find any of VanderMeer’s books there. I hold out hope that this will change, but for now, the Kindle store has served me well.</p>

<p>The first thing many people say when I tell them that I’ve been reading books on my iPhone is, “how can you read on that tiny screen?” I haven’t had any issues with the size of the iPhone 3g’s screen or the resolution. I stare at a computer monitor all day and that takes its toll on my eyes. But I don’t feel any eye strain reading my iPhone’s screen, even after a day in front of my computer. By all accounts, the new Android and Apple models have even better resolution, so an already good situation only gets better.</p>

<p>And there are advantages to reading on such a small device. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of reading a brick of a book like David Foster Wallace’s <cite class="bookTitle">Infinte Jest</cite> or Joyce’s <cite class="bookTitle">Ulysses</cite>, you will understand what I mean when I say that’s it’s a pleasure reading a book that you can easily hold in one hand. Even better, you’ve also got an entire library of books inside this tiny device that’s always in your pocket. As long as you remember to bring your phone with you, you’ll never be bored on the subway or in a waiting room again.</p>

<p>In the Kindle app, turning a page is a simple matter of tapping the right hand side of the screen with the thumb of the hand that’s holding the phone. This is actually surprisingly easy. In fact I find that I flip pages unconsciously, making the reading experience flow as if you were reading a continuous pageless text. In this sense, it’s fitting that the first e-book I read was by Kerouac who wrote another one of his works, <cite class="bookTitle">On the Road</cite>, as a continuous scroll.</p>

<p>But this pageless flow has it’s drawbacks. I miss the experience of intuitively knowing exactly where I am in a text by the thickness of the unread pages. Although the Kindle app provides a scroll bar at the bottom of the screen that indicates your place in the book, I still feel a bit lost. I have grown up with this physical feel for my progress through a book and it’s hard to leave this behind. I still find it easier to flip back through real pages to re-read a section or to flip forward to see where the chapter ends.</p>

<p>Then again the lack of pages works well with endnotes, which, in the Kindle app are hyperlinks. In <cite class="bookTitle">City of Saints and Madmen</cite>, one of the stories is full of endnotes. You simply tap the link, which brings you to the endnote. When you’re done reading it, you tap the back arrow to return to the text. An e-book version of <cite class="bookTitle">Infinite Jest</cite> would have worked so well this way. Flipping back and forth between the text and endnotes in that book was a source of frustration for me, though I’m sure Wallace intended it that way with his endnotes within endnotes. That said, I still had problems with the endnotes in <cite class="bookTitle">City of Saints and Madmen</cite>. I’ve got fat fingers and when the endnote link was at the righthand edge of the page it was difficult to hit it without turning the page. It is possible for iPhone programmers to enlarge the active space around a button or link, so perhaps the developers of the Kindle app could experiment with this. However, this might not be possible due to another feature of the Kindle app: the ability to tap on a word to either leave a note, highlight it or look it up in the dictionary. Widening the active area around an endnote link may interfere with the active area of the word itself.</p>

<p>I haven’t used notes or highlighting yet, but I love the dictionary function. When you tap on a word, its dictionary definition appears in a little box at the top or bottom of the page depending on the location of the word in question. I have always been a bit lazy about opening up a dictionary, so I love this feature. Unfortunately, I have encountered several words that aren’t in the version of the “New Oxford American Dictionary” that comes with the app. Apparently on the actual Kindle device, you have the option of buying a new dictionary and using that as your default dictionary. I hope they add this to the iPhone app, because I would love to upgrade the dictionary to a non-American Oxford English Dictionary with more words. Depending on what you’re reading, this might not even be an issue.</p>

<p>The thing I dislike most about reading e-books is their poor typography. In his piece <a title="Craigmod: Embracing the Digital Book" href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/">Embracing the Digital Book</a>, <a title="Craig Mod" href="http://craigmod.com">Craig Mod</a>, a designer who knows much more about typography than I do, covers all of my issues and more. I don’t have any problems with the font used in all Kindle books, PMN Caecilia, but I find the justified margins distracting. You end up with these awkward three-word lines with jarring space between the words. This could easily be solved with hyphenation. And I would prefer ragged right text like in a normal book. I’ll give Craig Mod the last word on this:&gt;Physical books and e-books are both text at their cores. Book designers long ago established rigorous rules for laying out text blocks so they disappear to the reader. They took pride in turning the physicality of a book into a tool for efficiently and elegantly getting information into the mind of the reader. As any good typographer knows: the best typography goes unnoticed.</p>

<p>I encourage you to read the rest of his piece because, among other things, it includes a fascinating exploration of what e-books could really be.</p>

<p>Craig Mod also points to one of the features I hate about the e-books I’ve read: Digital Rights Management. I love sharing traditional books with friends – to me, this sharing has always been an important part of enjoying books. It makes reading social. Sadly I cannot do this with my Kindle library. I think the publishing business needs to reconsider it’s use of DRM. In the music space, companies like iTunes are making money selling digital music. People buy music on iTunes instead of downloading it for free because it’s easier to do. The same would be true for books. Although social media has emerged to dominate the web, the book world has taken a step away from the social by locking up it’s e-books.</p>

<p>On a related point, it would be nice if I could buy books from multiple sources. Although Kindle and iBooks will never offer this, Google Editions seems to be moving in that direction. Like the DRM issue, this could easily be a topic for another long post, so I’ll only say this: I love small bookstores with their own carefully chosen selection of books.</p>

<p>One final gripe I have has more do with the fact that I’m reading on my iPhone; I am constantly interrupted by incoming emails, texts and phone calls. I don’t mind being interrupted by a phone call since I don’t use the phone much, but the emails and texts really test my ability to focus. It’s somehow easier to ignore the vibration or chime notifications for these messages when the phone is in your pocket. This is probably more a question of retraining myself than anything. But with a paper book, it’s much easier to eliminate distractions like this.</p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to e-books. Some of these disadvantages will likely be overcome. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy them, but, for me, they’re not going to replace traditional books anytime soon. Once I finish reading my most recent e-book acquisition, <cite class="bookTitle">The Art of Fiction</cite>, I will crack open M. John Harrison’s <cite class="bookTitle">Viriconium</cite>, a book that I purchased at a cool neighbourhood used bookstore yesterday.</p>
