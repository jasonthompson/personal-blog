<p>I can’t remember where I first heard about randonneuring, but Raymond Parker’s excellent site, <a href="http://veloweb.ca/randonneuring/">Velo Web</a>, has finally convinced me to give it a try. I’m going to cap off my upcoming week of vacation with Randonneurs Ontario’s <a href="http://www.randonneursontario.ca/routes/tor-pdf/Mean_Streets_200.pdf">Means Streets 200 km brevet (pdf)</a>. But since I haven’t done many long rides this year, I decided that I had better start “training”, so last Sunday I set out to ride to Georgetown and back. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-16"></a>It would also be a good opportunity to see if the tweaks I’d recently made to Tara’s front derailleur where successful.</p>

<p>Like many cyclists, my favourite roads to cycle are rural backroads, which are hard to find where I live in Toronto. The night before my Georgetown ride I consulted Google Maps in search of the quickest bike-friendly route out of town. Google tries its best to put you on bike paths and smaller roads, so it doesn’t pick the fastest route. I made a few modifications to the parts of the route I was familiar with, but deferred to Google for most of the directions. Perhaps this was a mistake.</p>

<p>The first time I got lost was in Centennial Park. Up to that point my route had been rather direct: west on Dupont to Dundas, north on Scarlett to Eglinton and then west along a bike path just south of Eglinton. I had been worried about the Eglinton part, never having cycled that street so close to the airport, but the separate bike path turned out to be nice. But the path ends at Centennial Park on Toronto’s boundary with Mississauga. Since my goal for the day was north of the city, I didn’t see the wisdom in heading south into the park’s confusing trails, but it was a beautiful morning and I was making great time. And the park would give me an opportunity for a nature break.</p>

<p>I managed to get through the park with the help of a kindly man out walking his dog. In fact he helped me <em>twice</em>. I finally got out of the park only to add my first bonus kilometres of the day. Google was telling me to turn left despite the fact that I was sure I needed to go right. Nevertheless, I dubiously deferred to Google and proceeded south. By the time I decided that I’d been heading South too long, I’d gone at least a kilometre out of my way. With the help of Google Maps on my phone (no bike directions on the iPhone app!), I got back on track adding about two or three kilometres. No big deal.</p>

<p>“Back on track” took me through the interminable twists and turns of light industry near Canada’s largest airport. I was amused to see that these industrial parks sported names like The Churchill Industrial Community. This park hosts to the mighty Loblaws and features a small lake in a crater surrounded by well-tended turf and the odd park bench. Somewhere nice to escape for lunch, I guess. But I wasn’t interested in eating lunch yet this early in the morning. It was Sunday, so the industrial parks were deserted, allowing me to wend my way north and west in solitude.</p>

<figure> 
<img src="/images/2011/08/goose-crossing.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>A look at the sky before leaving.</figcaption> </figure>

<p>The problem with this solitude is that it was bought at the expense of speed. And you quickly lose your sense of direction navigating these curvy streets. But my desire for solitude won out over the need for a direct route , so I followed Google’s instructions, avoiding major roads as much as possible. And, as you can clearly see by the image above, this route did afford some encounters with nature. The geese stretched from one side of the street to another, so I stopped to snap a pick. When they seemed to be moving on, I started pedalling again, throwing their ragtag flock into disarray. Some of them sped up their pace across the street while others turned to hiss at me.</p>

<p>During the industrial phase of my journey, I had Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe express in my head and I kept imagining how J.G. Ballard would narrate the landscape.</p>

<p>I was making good time and soon I was racing along Steeles to 9th Line. This was to be the all-to-short rural segment of the ride, because, within no time, I was lost in the outskirts of Georgetown. From a bike tour earlier this year, I recalled a beautifully preserved Main Street that bore further exploration. What my wife and I hadn’t experienced at the time was the suburban sprawl on the south side of town. This is where Google’s directions ended. I had done more than 50 kilometres in really good time, so I considered turning back and retracing my steps, but I wanted a glimpse of idilic Main Street. With the further help of Google and some friendly joggers, I managed to make my way there, where I saw I coffee shop featuring organic coffee and a group of regulars nursing their coffees outside. I pulled Tara up to the side of the coffee shop and dug around the handlebar bag for money. This is when I noticed that I’d forgotten my wallet and change.</p>

<p>Oh well, at least I had some water and a banana. I walked over to a retaining wall in front of a church, which was still deserted this early on a Sunday morning. I sat there a few minutes, writing a text home, eating and drinking.</p>

<figure> 
<img src="/images/2011/08/tara-resting-in-georgetown.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Georgetown main street.</figcaption> </figure>

<p>The ride back home wasn’t that eventful. I decided to follow Main out of town, which quickly turns into 8th Line, heading back south through some pleasantly rural kilometres. I was making great time now, my speed easily climbing to 30+ km/h between stop signs.</p>

<p>One of the other disadvantages of the circuitous route I’d followed in the morning, was that its frequent twists and turns kept me concentrating on the next navigational cue when I really just wanted to relax and enjoy the ride, so I decided to follow 9th line south of Steeles and then cut across Eglinton on my way back.</p>

<p>ississauga abruptly begins at 9th line near Eglinton. To my right the landscape was decidedly rural, but to my left were endless rows of townhouses. I turned onto Eglinton and rode it for what seemed like hours. Of course I had underestimated how long I’d have to ride this suburban thoroughfare before reaching the relative peace of the bike path, which starts at the edge of Toronto.</p>

<p>And I also started to run low on water. I was using a stainless steel water bottle from MEC that was hard to drink from while in motion, so I was only drinking at stops. Unfortunately, because of this, I wasn’t drinking nearly as much as I should have. I also ran out of food. Without money there was nothing I could do about that. I could have stopped for water from a gas station sink, but I was also hyper focused on getting home.</p>

<p>The one nice thing about this ride from one side of Mississauga to the other, was that I reached one hundred kilometres in exactly four hours of ride time.</p>

<p>By the time I got home, the humidity, thirst and hunger where getting to me. During the last few kilometre, I fantasized about a burger and a pint or two of beer (I know, that wouldn’t have helped my dehydration, but I was bonking here). Thankfully, MM had prepared a delightful chicken salad accompanied by the best biscuits (and gluten-free to boot!), so my hunger was soon satiated.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that I’d take this route again. It was definitely a confidence booster. I rode the 118 kilometres in about five and a half hours or 4:53 of actual ride time, but the endless suburban riding was a chore.</p>

<p>Preferences aside, I learned some important lessons:* Bring money* Eat and drink frequently* Carefully vet your cue sheet before the ride* Use a squeezable water bottle that allow drinking on the go.</p>

<p>Now it was time to start planning next week’s ride.</p>

<p>I do my best not to get too hung up on what writing tools to use. But after my daughter’s iMac died I was forced to convert all of her Pages documents to Word format so she could edit them on a Linux laptop. I too have old documents I can no longer open due to changes in tools and obsolete file formats, so I decided that I would start doing all of my writing in text using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> for simple formatting. That way, as long as I have a text editor, my documents will always be available to me. And, using a tool like <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, it’s trivial to convert a Markdown file to the format of your choice.</p>

<p>At first I thought I’d stick with a text editor like TextMate or Vim, but, while adequate, these applications are better suited to writing programs. And I had been hearing about this new application for OSX called <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">IA Writer</a>. It’s designed from the ground up for writing prose in markdown and, with Fullscreen and Focus Modes, it provides a great distraction-free writing environment. Fullscreen Mode is easy on your eyes with a large off-white background and a perfectly-sized font. And Focus Mode greys out all but the current sentence. I wasn’t sure if I’d find this latter mode useful, but I have used it constantly.</p>

<p>There are no other features to speak of in IA Writer, but that’s what makes it so useful. I’ve been working on a short story for the past few weeks and IA Writer has allowed me to focus on my writing like never before. IA Writer is opinionated software: if you enjoy tweaking your writing environment or formatting your documents just so, then it’s not for you. But if you’d just like to concentrate on writing great prose, perhaps you should check it out.</p>

    <p>I’m currently reading <a title="Geeta Dayal's blog" href="http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/">Geeta Dayal’s</a> exploration of Brian Eno’s creative process <a title="Another Green World" href="http://www.amazon.ca/Brian-Enos-Another-Green-World/dp/0826427863/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308077919&amp;sr=8-3">in her book</a> about Brian Eno’s 1975 album, <a title="Wikipedia: Another Green World" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Green_World">Another Green World</a>. One aspect of this creative process that I find particularly fascinating is Eno’s use of <a title="Wikipedia: Generative Music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music">generative techniques</a>. My interest piqued, I read about <a title="Wikipedia: Generative Art" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative techniques in other arts</a> and rediscover <a title="Wikipedia: Jeff Noon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Noon">Jeff Noon’s</a> work via this piece on <a title="Wikipedia: Cut-up technique" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique">Cut-up techniques</a>. I say “rediscover” because Noon’s books fell off the end of my always-growing list of things to read a long time ago, so I’m returning him to the top of this list. Actually–scratch that–maybe not the top. Noon himself contributes to his quick demotion on my list with his <a title="Jeff Noon's top 10 fluid fiction books" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/jan/17/bestbooks.fiction">list of top ten fluid fiction books</a> wherein he recommends <a title="The Age of Wire and String" href="http://benmarcus.com/books/the-age-of-wire-and-string/">Ben Marcus’s “The Age of Wire and String”</a>. Always a sucker for the off-beat and/ or experimental I head on over to Marcus’s site, which links to <a title="I Can't Really Help It: A Conversation with Ben Marcus" href="http://htmlgiant.com/feature/i-cant-really-help-it-a-conversation-with-ben-marcus/">an interesting interview with him</a> at HTMLGiant. And, yet again, a new book is added to the top of my reading list as Marcus recommends John D’Agata’s book-length essay, <a title="About a Mountain" href="http://www.amazon.ca/About-Mountain-John-Dagata/dp/0393339017/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308076049&amp;sr=8-1">About a Mountain</a>, which is described by Booklist as a “circuitous, stylish investigation” in which “D’Agata (Halls of Fame) uses the federal government’s highly controversial (and recently rejected) proposal to entomb the U.S.’s nuclear waste located in Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, as his way into a spiralling and subtle examination of the modern city, suicide, linguistics, Edvard Munch’s The Scream, ecological and psychic degradation, and the gulf between information and knowledge”. I love essays and documentaries that take a collage-like approach. In fact I’m currently developing a multimedia project/ documentary of my own that’s structured this way. So, hungry for a sample of D’Agata’s work, I read his piece, <a title="Joan Didion's Formal Experience of Confusion" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200310/?read=article_dagata">Joan Didion’s Formal Experience of Confusion</a> right away. I am also looking forward to reading his international anthology, <a title="Joan Didion's Formal Experience of Confusion" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200310/?read=article_dagata">The Lost Origins of the Essay</a>,”An expansive and exhilarating world tour of innovative nonfiction writing”.</p>

<p>After a late lunch on the patio of the Bedford Academy, <a title="Peter Van Garderen's blog" href="http://archivemati.ca/about/,">Peter</a> and I wandered up Prince Arthur Avenue to catch a matinée at the Varsity. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and we were in no hurry, so we stopped to admire <a title="Uno Prii Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Prii,">Uno Prii’s</a> Prince Arthur Towers. Like any other city, Toronto is full of bland residential architecture built after WWII, but there are exceptions. Harry Hiller, for one, hired Prii for his projects, resulting in some of Toronto’s finest buildings from the 60s. Today amidst Toronto’s condo boom, most of the new residential buildings are forgettable, to say the least. Sadly, it’s difficult to force a developer to design a building that makes a statement other than, “we’ve spent as little as possible on architecture here”. But, here and there, you can find gems like Prince Arthur Towers that richen the environment around them.</p>

  </header>

  <div class="article-wrap">
    <figure><img src="/images/2011/05/curving-road.jpg" alt="curvingroad" /></figure>
<p>In the past few days I’ve made some changes to Digressions, most of which are invisible to readers. The following is a detailed description of these changes. Be forewarned.
&lt;h2 id="changing-platforms-and-hosts"&gt;Changing Platforms and Hosts&lt;/h2&gt;
I’m an inveterate builder. Along with ideas for writing, photography, video and music projects, I’m always entertaining a few software ideas. So a few months ago, I decided to dust off my Ruby skills and learn Ruby on Rails to bring some of these ideas to fruition. I laid the groundwork for this tinkering by moving Digressions to a virtual server at <a title="Slicehost" href="http//www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a>. Having a virtual server gives me the flexibility to set up the programming environment of my choice.</p>

<p>There are plenty of great books and <a title="Michael Hartl's Excellent 'Ruby on Rails Tutorial'" href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">tutorials</a> for Rails, but I learn best by getting my hands dirty, so I decided to write my own blogging platform. For an experienced Rails programmer this could be done in a day or two. For someone like me who has dived in over his head, this took a few months of working an hour or two everyday before going to work. In the end I learned rails, but abandoned the blogging platform leaving it 80% complete.</p>

<p>While I didn’t end up finishing my blogging platform this project taught me a lot. One important thing I learned was to trust my instincts. And my instincts were telling me that Rails is too big for the task at hand. Sure, you could use Rails to create a wonderful blogging platform, but I wanted something simpler. Just as I was coming to this realization, I stumbled across <a title="Jekyll--a blog-aware static site generator for Ruby" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, “a blog-aware static site generator for Ruby”. The concept is simple:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Write your post using the text editor of your choice (I use MacVim) and save it in a folder called “_posts”;</li>
	<li>If you’ve got images, save them in an images folder;</li>
	<li>Run Jekyll at the command line in your blog folder to create the “_site” folder;</li>
	<li>Deploy the contents of the “_site” folder using whatever method you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds more complicated than it actually is. I created a script that takes care of the last two steps automatically.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to this way of doing things. For one thing, “baking” your weblog (i.e., generating static web pages instead of serving dynamic pages) results in better performance when visitor traffic spikes. <a title="A plea for baked weblogs" href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">Brent Simmons</a> and <a title="More on Baking" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/18/Baking-ongoing">Tim Bray</a> recently made strong arguments in favor of baking, so I won’t repeat them here. Another advantage is that your blog is automatically backed up. At the very least there is one copy on your computer and another on your server. Moreover, because there’s always a local copy of your blog and because there are no databases to fiddle with, deploying to a new host is trivial. In contrast, moving a Wordpress or Moveable Type blog can be a pain. But even if you never plan on changing hosts, it’s nice to have your posts living in text files rather than hidden away in a database. Finally, if you want to make changes or add plugins, the Jekyll code is easy to wrap your head around.
&lt;h2 id="design-tweaks"&gt;Design Tweaks&lt;/h2&gt;
While moving Digressions to a new platform, I decided to update the design. To begin with, I reimplemented the existing design using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr>. If you look at the page source, you’ll see that moving to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> paid off in cleaner markup. A lot of the header cruft is gone and semantic tags make your structure clear. And it’s a lot easier to style and/ or modify clearly structured <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. With the new <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in place, I tweaked the design to achieve a cleaner look. The most obvious changes are related to typography. I replaced Anivers, the font I was using for titles, with Adobe’s Myriad Pro Condensed because Anivers wasn’t displaying nicely on Windows XP computers (don’t get me started about Windows XP font rendering). Font sizes where also changed to make the design look more proportional on multiple devices. And taking the advice of <a title="The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web" href="http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.2/">The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a>, I narrowed the paragraphs keeping lines between 65 and 70 characters long to enhance readability.</p>

<p>The redesign is still a work in progress (I <em>did</em> mention I was an inveterate builder). I only have Macs and Linux computers at home, so testing on Internet Explorer is difficult. That said, I have <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 8 at work, so I can check the site there and then make my tweaks at home. It’s currently readable on <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 8, but not as pretty as it is on modern browsers. A while back I made a commitment to stop waisting my time on designing around the quirks of outdated browsers, but I’ll make a few small tweaks to improve rendering in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 8.</p>

<p>Now with all this change out of the way I can start posting words and images again. After all, isn’t that what blogs are for?</p>
